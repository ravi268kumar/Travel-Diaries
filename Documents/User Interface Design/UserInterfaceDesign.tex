User interface design (UI) is the design of user interfaces for mobile software with the focus on maximizing the user satisfaction. The goal of
user interface design is to make the userâ€™s interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals (user-centered design). We have used proto.io to design UI for Android Mobile.
